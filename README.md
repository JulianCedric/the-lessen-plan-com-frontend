PREMISE:
Everybody wants a transformation, right? 

Everybody wants a radical improvement, rapid success.

But we fail to realize that small habits and little choices are transforming us everyday already. 

That these times when you make a choice that is slightly better or slightly worse, 1% better or 1% worse, that these things compound over time.   

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

And so, if you can learn to master those, then you can make time work for you rather than against you, right?

Good habits make time your ally.

Bad habits make time your enemy.

DRAFTS: 

TheLessenPlan introduces users to a system for continuous self-improvement that focuses on helping them do less of what isn't working so that they can do more of what is. 

How It Works:

Notes: 

Each Lessen Plan is tailored specifically to the user, based on input they

Addt'l / Misc:

*MVP: An app that allows users to easily track anything they want to start tracking and for how long - consider adding React Calendar.

*User should be able to create categories as well - consider adding drag & drop.

2021.03.25 - THU:

*Consider making this app a combination of the concepts in 'Atomic Habits' and 'What to Say..'

let array = [1, -1, 5, 3, -7, 4, 5, 6, -100, 4]

function largestSubarraySum(array){
    let arr = [1, 1, 5, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 100, 4]
    let sum = arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] + arr[5] + arr[6] + arr[7] + arr[8] + arr[9] + 23
    return sum
}

largestSubarraySum(array)

User Journey:

A user journey begins every time a user becomes aware of a particular behavior. 
They ask, "Would it be a good thing or a bad thing if I repeated this behavior 
every day for the rest of my life?" They then enter that behavior into the app, 
tag it as either good or bad, and depending on which they select, will be guided
through a series of questions that once complete, a user will receive a 'Lessen 
Plan' ( printable ) for either establishing or eliminating the behavior. 

Each Lessen Plan is tailored specifically to the user, based on input they 
provide the app about their current main goal and/or situation.

THE LESSEN PLAN

    App Overview:

        An app that helps you build the habits you need to get the results you want. 

    How Does It Work?

        1. Identify what you want.
        2. Identify the habits you need to get what you want.
        3. Make these NEW habits a part of your daily routine:
           This process:
            a. Identify your CURRENT set of habits ( your daily routine ), 
            b. Build systems to establish your NEW habits,
            c. Build systems to eliminate your OLD ( or 'bad' ) habits.
        4. Track your progress daily.
        5. Review your progress weekly:
            a. What's working?
            b. What's not? And what can you do about it ( to make it work )?
--
Another way of saying lines 3, 4, and 5:

"Systematically 'install' these new habits into your daily routine while systematically eliminating any habits that no longer serve you ( in the pursuit of your goal )." 

"Track progress."

"Review progress ( to determine potential areas of improvement )."
