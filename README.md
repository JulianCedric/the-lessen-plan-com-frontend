# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

User Journey:

A user journey begins every time a user becomes aware of a particular behavior. 
They ask, "Would it be a good thing or a bad thing if I repeated this behavior 
every day for the rest of my life?" They then enter that behavior into the app, 
tag it as either good or bad, and depending on which they select, will be guided
through a series of questions that once complete, a user will receive a 'Lessen 
Plan' ( printable ) for either establishing or eliminating the behavior. 

Each Lessen Plan is tailored specifically to the user, based on input they 
provide the app about their current main goal and/or situation.

THE LESSEN PLAN

    App Overview:

        An app that helps you build the habits you need to get the results you want. 

    How Does It Work?

        1. Identify what you want.
        2. Identify the habits you need to get what you want.
        3. Make these NEW habits a part of your daily routine:
           This process:
            a. Identify your CURRENT set of habits ( your daily routine ), 
            b. Build systems to establish your NEW habits,
            c. Build systems to eliminate your OLD ( or 'bad' ) habits.
        4. Track your progress daily.
        5. Review your progress weekly:
            a. What's working?
            b. What's not? And what can you do about it ( to make it work )?
--
Another way of saying lines 3, 4, and 5:

"Systematically 'install' these new habits into your daily routine while systematically eliminating any habits that no longer serve you ( in the pursuit of your goal )." 

"Track progress."

"Review progress ( to determine potential areas of improvement )."
